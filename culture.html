            Why is it Popular?
        </h2>
        <p>
            Tea culture is defined by how tea is made and consumed, how people interact with tea, and the aesthetics surrounding tea drinking.

            Tea plays an important role in some countries. It is commonly consumed at social events, and many cultures have created intricate formal ceremonies for these events. East Asian tea ceremonies, with their roots in the Chinese tea culture, differ slightly among East Asian countries, such as the Japanese or Korean variants. Tea may differ widely in preparation, such as in Tibet, where the beverage is commonly brewed with salt and butter. Tea may be drunk in small private gatherings (tea parties) or public (tea houses designed for social interaction).

            Afternoon tea is a British custom with widespread appeal. The British Empire spread an interpretation of tea to its dominions and colonies, including modern-day regions of Hong Kong, India, and Pakistan, which had pre-existing tea customs, as well as regions such as East Africa (modern-day Kenya, Tanzania, and Uganda) and the Pacific (Australia and New Zealand) which did not have tea customs. The tea room or teahouse is found in the US, Ireland and many Commonwealth cities.

        <p>Tea has been associated with luxury and expense for centuries, with its origins dating back to ancient China where it was reserved for the elite classes. Today, the culture of expensive and luxurious tea continues in various parts of the world, including Japan, the UK, and parts of the Middle East. High-quality teas, such as rare varieties of oolong, white, and black teas, are often considered a symbol of sophistication and refinement. The cost of these teas can vary widely depending on the rarity and quality of the tea leaves, as well as the processing methods used. For tea enthusiasts, the enjoyment of a cup of exquisite and costly tea can be a truly indulgent and satisfying experience.</p>
